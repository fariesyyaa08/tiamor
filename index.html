      Hello, love 💌. <br>
      Look, there's a button below me..
      DON'T CLICK IT. TRUST ME.
    </p>

    <button id="surpriseBtn" onclick="reveal()">Super DUPER danger</button>

    <p id="surprise" class="hidden"></p>

      AHAHAHAHDEBFJEWK hii, this is very cliche but whatever. I just wanna say this properly because sometimes
      I joke around too much and don’t say things clearly,
      but I care about you, A LITTLEEE, and you’re not alone even when your brain tells you otherwise.
      Your friends care about you too, and I hope you never forget that you matter to more people than you realize,
      especially to MEEEE, kot. Idk what to write anymore, but I’m trying anyway, so bear with me.
      PLEASE don’t skip meals, okay? Food is important— your brain needs fuel, love. if hilang selera,
      minum sikit okay? empty stomach is not good AT ALL. Study well and do your best, I know you’re capable of doing great!!
      but don’t push yourself until you break. Your mental health comes first, always. OKAAYYYYY??????
      Grades are important, yes, but YOU are more important. And hey, no self-harm, alright? That’s non-negotiable.
      I ada kawan macam tu juga, and guess what? nothing changes in her life. So what's the point of hurting yourself kan?
      it's useless, pointless, and even childish. You're making a fool out of yourself. If something feels too heavy, messy or confusing,
      come to me— complain, rant, go silent with me, whatever. And you know what? God is there, always by your side. So, luah dekat Allah okay?
      Buat la apa pun, solat, doa, alquran, Allah ada dengan you. You nak cry yourself out? that's totally fine, okay?
      Cry whenever you wanted to. It's not illegal, asalkan you rasa lega. Oh and, If things ever get complicated or hard,
      I’m here, always, even from far away, quietly supporting you and rooting for you as if im your biggest fan.
      AND FINE, YEAAAHHH YOU'RE HANDSOMEEE, CUTE, SMART, EVERYTHINGGG, WHATEVER YOU SAY. HAHAHHAAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA IT FEELS WEIRD.
      I never thought i akan jumpa someone after my ex, because he's my first experience. But woooaah, I dont want to assume things yet,
      but if this is fate, 
      I hope you can be someone whos 10x better than my ex.
      LASSSSSTTTTLYYYYYY, take care and everything, 143.
