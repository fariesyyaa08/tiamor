      AHAHAHAHDEBFJEWK hiii,
      this is very cliche but whatever. You know, it’s kind of ridiculous,
      even when my brain is drowning in a million things, I catch myself checking my phone just to see if you’ve messaged. 
      It’s like this tiny little thrill that makes everything else a little lighter. ANDDD i appreciate you so much for
      those silly paragraph, it was ADORABLE. I can't stop reading it. So, this is how i repay you. At first, i rasa macam
      tak perlu kot buat ni semua, but why not right? FUHH LAIN DARI YANG LAIN AHHSJAHSJHQJJJAAAA. So i decided untuk
      buat ni just for you, a very simple one. And I just wanna say this properly because sometimes
      I joke around way too much and don’t say things clearly,
      but I care about you, A LITTLEEE, and you’re not alone even when your brain tells you otherwise.
      Your friends care about you too, and I hope you never forget that you matter to more people than you realize,
      especially to MEEEE, kot. Idk what to write anymore, but I’m trying anyway, so bear with me.
      PLEASE don’t skip meals, okay? Food is important— your brain needs fuel. if hilang selera,
      minum sikit okay? empty stomach is not good AT ALL. Study well and do your best, I know you’re capable of doing great!!
      but don’t push yourself until you break. Your mental health comes first, always. Get some proper sleep.
      Minimum 6 or 7 hours. You need energy, especially since you're still young. OKAAYYYYY??????
      Grades are important, yes, but YOU are more important. And hey, no self-harm, alright? That’s non-negotiable.
      I ada kawan macam tu juga, and nothing changes in her life. So what's the point of hurting yourself kan?
      it's useless, pointless, and even childish. You're making a fool out of yourself. If something feels too heavy, messy or confusing,
      come to me— complain, rant, go silent with me, whatever. And you know what? God is there, always by your side. So, luah dekat Allah okay?
      Buat la apa pun, solat, doa, alquran, Allah ada dengan you. You nak cry yourself out? that's totally fine, okay?
      Cry whenever you wanted to. It's not illegal, asalkan you rasa lega. Oh and, If things ever get complicated or hard,
      I’m here, always, even from far away, quietly supporting you and rooting for you as if im your biggest fan. 
      LASSSSSTTTTLYYYYYY, take care and everything. Im proud of you.
